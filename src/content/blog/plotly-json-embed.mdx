This post demonstrates loading a Plotly chart definition (`data`, `layout`, optional `config`) from Hetzner Object Storage and rendering it directly inside MDX.

<PlotlyFromJson
	src="https://your-bucket.your-region.your-objectstorage.com/charts/example-plotly.json"
	height="520px"
/>

If the chart does not render, confirm that your object is publicly readable and your bucket CORS allows browser `GET` requests from your site domain.
